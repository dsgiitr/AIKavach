## Introduction

Neural networks (NNs) have achieved great advances on a wide range of classification tasks, but have been shown vulnerable against adversarial examples(adversarial pertubations) and thus there is a line of work aiming to provide robustness certification for NNs.

This project aims to provide to provide certified robustness for large-scale datasets against adversarial pertubations using various defenses proposed to robustify deep learning models particularly randomized smoothing.
